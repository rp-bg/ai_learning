intelligence is the ability to learn from experience.
learning requires repetition.
repetition builds understanding.

a program is a set of instructions.
a good program is simple.
a great program is simple and correct.

rust is a systems programming language.
rust emphasizes safety and performance.
ownership prevents data races.

machine learning is not magic.
it is math plus data.
models learn patterns from examples.

a neural network is a function.
it maps inputs to outputs.
weights define the behavior.

transformers use attention.
attention allows tokens to communicate.
self attention looks at itself.

the gpu runs kernels.
kernels process many values at once.
parallelism makes things fast.

memory usage depends on workload.
longer sessions use more memory.
more requests increase memory pressure.

a model predicts the next token.
training minimizes loss.
loss measures how wrong the prediction is.

adam is an optimizer.
it adapts learning rates.
it helps training converge.

relu introduces nonlinearity.
without relu the model is linear.
nonlinearity increases expressiveness.

software is built step by step.
understanding beats memorization.
clarity beats cleverness.

hello world.
hello rust.
hello machine learning.
